There have been many changes in 2023 that have brought on the need to make adjustments and change. One of these for me was that after over 10 years of being on Tumblr, they have chosen not to let content creators to have their own domain names. Instead they are charging to have custom domains owned by them. With these abrupt changes, I've had to find the time to whip up a custom theme and start the process of transitioning all the posts over to this location instead.

You can still view the [Tumblr](https://leesheppard.tumblr.com) site, it just won't be from my custom domain.
