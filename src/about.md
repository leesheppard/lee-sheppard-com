I've been a professional cartoonist since I was 15 years old. I've headed up for
the world's oldest cartoonists association as VP and organised many conferences along
the way. I've worked in animation studios on productions for many major film and
television networks. It has been a long road since that first paid published drawing
and whilst it hasn't always been the easiest career path to follow, it has been full
of memories and great stories to collect.

When I was a teenager, I was lucky enough to be introduced by a school friend to
a cartoonist who happened to be their neighbour. This cartoonist happened to be a
Guiness Book record holder for drawing a comic strip unaided for over 50 years.
And with that introduction I was mentored for many years by Jim Russell.

I freelanced for the best part of my career as the work is very seasonal. I followed
the work where and when it happened and was involved in many various sectors of the
creative industry. From animation, laser displays, live caricature work to drawing
a syndicated comic strip.

I found my comfort in creating owner/original works, not so much in projects that
didn't provide much input into the final production. It's within the creativity of
freedom in expression that I found my happy place. Making my own stories, creating new
characters and developing properties as a creator/executive producer/runner.

I've been involved in the technology industry too. There's a place for art in tech
and a place for tech in art. I'm still finding where that sweet spot is with the two
and I'm enjoying learning from the experience of it all.

Got any questions? have something interesting you think I could help with?
